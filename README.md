# Java-Game
A simple game I've created using Java

Included is the full build of the project: CS493Project. 

This game was made as the capstone product of my CS 493 course at Regis University. Included is the "Capstone Product" a game design document which lists the high-level project layout, and some of the particulars for those whom like to promote a game's story, concept, etc.

The project required managing several concurrency issues; many of which were handled by directly applying operating systems concepts (mutexes and buffers primarily). 

Movement and AI were largely overlooked in favor of making a functional game engine; however, basic trigonometric concepts were employed to facilitate some interactivity between the player and the game, and several enemy difficulties were implemented to introduce variety.
